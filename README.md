### Hi there & welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹


- :briefcase: For my day job, Iâ€™m currently managing a small team focuesd on piloting data solutions, experimentation & implementing data science projects for a specialty insurance carrier. 
- :mortar_board: Iâ€™m generally intrigued by many topics at once, but I am currently focused on a few larger projects/topics:
  - :rocket: Exploring build and release tools (i.e. Github Actions / Azure DevOps pipelines)
  - :package: Having built several internal R packages, I would like to develop a small R package for release on CRAN
  - :octocat: Increase my understanding of git (I mostly use it a high-level, but don't explore things like `reset` or `revert`)
