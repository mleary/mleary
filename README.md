### Hi there & welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹


- :briefcase: For my day job, Iâ€™m currently focused on advancing Gen AI capabilities across Markel, a specialty insurance carrier.


- :mortar_board: Iâ€™m generally intrigued by many topics at once, but I am currently focused on a few larger projects/topics:
  
  - :rocket: Building a [personal AI assistant](https://github.com/mleary/leary_ai) for my family.
    
  - :package: I've built multiple internal R packages and Python modules for data science work, and I'm exploring more advanced package management hosted remotely.
