### Hi there & welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹


- :briefcase: For my day job, Iâ€™m currently managing a small team focuesd on piloting data solutions, experimentation & implementing data science projects for a specialty insurance carrier. 
- :mortar_board: Iâ€™m generally intrigued by many topics at once, but I am currently focused on a few larger projects/topics:
  - :construction: Rebuilding my personal website with Quarto
  - :rocket: Exploring build and release tools (i.e. Github Actions / Azure DevOps pipelines)
  - :package: Having built several internal R packages, I would like to develop a small R package for release on CRAN
  - :octocat: Increase my understanding of git (I mostly use it a high-level, but don't explore things like `reset` or `revert`)

- :globe_with_meridians: Visit my personal website [here](https://www.mattleary.com)
- :memo: See my resume [here](https://mattleary-resume.netlify.app/)
- :cook: I keep collection of [recipes](https://mleary.github.io/cooking_recipes/index.html) I regularly use in an Rmarkdown.  It was really a way for me to explore using Github Actions for the first time to rebuild a website whenever I updated a csv file.
